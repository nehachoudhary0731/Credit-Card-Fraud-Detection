# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. 
It tackles real-world challenges such as class imbalance and minimal feature availability, making it ideal for financial anomaly detection.

# Overview
- Developed a binary classification model to identify fraudulent transactions.
- Used techniques like data cleaning, feature scaling, and SMOTE to handle imbalance.
- Trained multiple models and compared their performance.
